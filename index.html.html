        <p>The traditional meat for kebabs is most often <b>lamb</b> meat,
             but regional recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish,
              or even pork (depending on whether or not there are specific religious prohibitions).</p>

              <p>The chosen protein is sliced very thinly, pounded out further, and seasoned with spices like garlic,
                 cumin, coriander, paprika, and oregano.
                  This meat is speared on a large vertical skewer and slowly cooked as it rotates via electric,
                   gas, or wood-fired heat.</p>

                   <p>They are thought to have originated in <b>Turkey</b> when soldiers used to
                     grill chunks of freshly hunted animals skewered on swords over open field fires.
                     This origin is backed up by a Turkish script of Kyssa-I Yusuf in 1377 and is 
                     now the oldest known source where kebabis stated as a food item.</p>

                     <p>The beautiful, roasted, slightly charred and flavorful stacks of meat are the heart and soul of doner kebabs.
                         Meat that's past its prime or has stayed too long in the freezer
                          lose their ability to soak up all the rich marinade flavors
                           as well as their ability for<u> tenderness and juiciness</u>.</p>
